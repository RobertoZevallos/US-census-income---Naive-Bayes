# US census income - Naive Bayes

An analysis of the given US census data set was conducted with the use of Python to prepare data and subset training and testing sets. The data was then analyzed with a Excel based Na√Øve Bayes classifier system to predict people with specific characteristics that will earn $50k or more in the US.  The results show a model with a precision of 51%, which can be further improved by grouping the variables differently, and a good recall and false negative rates of 87% and 6% respectively.

The project report includes an important section regarding the project learnings achieved by developing it by using both Python and Excel, and the lessons learned to improve teamwork in analytical projects. 

The files included are:
1. Project report (US census income - Naive Bayes - Report.pdf).
2. Jupyter notebook for data preparation to develop training and testing sets (Data Prep for Naive Bayes.ipynb).
3. Raw data used in the Jupyter notebook (US Census Above 50k Predictor.csv).
4. Naives Bayes Excel file (US census income - Naive Bayes.zip).
